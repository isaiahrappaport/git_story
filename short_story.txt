Once there was a girl named Phillipia. She was 12 years old and loved chocolate milk. 
But not just any chocolate milk. 
She loved the chocolate milk bar that her daddy gave her the night before his death.
Ever since then she tried day and night to replicate that bar of chocolate milk.
The only problem was no one knew the recipe.
That's becuase it didn't exist.
Phillipia was crazy.

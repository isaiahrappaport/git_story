Once there was a girl named Phillipia. She was 12 years old and loved chocolate. 
But not just any chocolate. 
She loved the chocolate bar that her daddy gave her the night before his death.
Ever since then she tried day and night to replicate that bar of chocolate.
The only problem was no one knew the recipe.
That's becuase it didn't exist.
Phillipia was crazy.

Once there was a boy named Phillip. He was 12 years old and loved chocolate. 
But not just any chocolate. 
He loved the chocolate bar that his daddy gave him the night before his death.
Ever since then he tried day and night to replicate that bar of chocolate.
The only problem was no one knew the recipe.
That's becuase it didn't exist.
Phillip was crazy.
